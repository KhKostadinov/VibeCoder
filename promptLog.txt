Here's an example of how you could read and merge Excel data files using Python:
'''
import pandas as pd

# Read the first file
df1 = pd.read_excel('file1.xlsx')

# Read the second file
df2 = pd.read_excel('file2.xlsx')

# Merge the two dataframes on a common column
merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='common_column')

# Print the merged dataframe
print(merged_df)
'''
This code assumes that you have two Excel files named `file1.xlsx` and `file2.xlsx`, and that they both contain a column called `common_column`. The `merge()` function is used to merge the two dataframes on this common column, resulting in a new dataframe that contains all the rows from both files.

You can also use the `concat()` function to concatenate the two dataframes instead of merging them:
```
merged_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)
```
This will create a new dataframe that contains all the rows from both files, with the rows from `file1.xlsx` appearing first and the rows from `file2.xlsx` appearing second.

You can also use the `merge()` function to merge multiple dataframes at once:
```
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column')
```
This will create a new dataframe that contains all the rows from both files, with the rows from `file1.xlsx` appearing first and the rows from `file2.xlsx` appearing second.

You can also use the `concat()` function to concatenate multiple dataframes at once:
```
merged_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)
```
This will create a new dataframe that contains all the rows from both files, with the rows from `file1.xlsx` appearing first and the rows from `file2.xlsx` appearing second.

You can also use the `merge()` function to merge multiple dataframes based on different columns:
```
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on=['common_column', 'other_column'])
```
This will create a new dataframe that contains all the rows from both files, with the rows from `file1.xlsx` appearing first and the rows from `file2.xlsx` appearing second. The `on` parameter specifies the columns to merge on.

You can also use the `concat()` function to concatenate multiple dataframes based on different columns:
```
merged_df = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)
```
This will create a new dataframe that contains all the rows from both files, with the rows from `file1.xlsx` appearing first and the rows from `file2.xlsx` appearing second. The `axis` parameter specifies the dimension along which to concatenate the dataframes.

# Load Excel files
file1 = pd.read_excel('file1.xlsx')
file2 = pd.read_excel('file2.xlsx')

# Merge the files
merged_data = file1.merge(file2, on='common column name', how='outer')

# Save the merged data to a new Excel file
merged_data.to_excel('merged_data.xlsx', index=False)
'''
This code uses the pandas library to load two Excel files and merge them based on a common column name. The `on` parameter specifies the column used for merging, and the `how` parameter specifies the type of merge (in this case, an outer join). Finally, the merged data is saved to a new Excel file using the `to_excel()` method.

Note that you will need to replace `'file1.xlsx'` and `'file2.xlsx'` with the actual names of your Excel files, and `'common column name'` with the name of the column that contains the common data between the two files. You may also want to adjust the `how` parameter depending on your specific needs (e.g., if you want an inner join instead of an outer join).
